# FASDH25-portfolio2
A repository for students' portfolios for mini-project 2
While performing Task 2A, we adapted our regex-based script to extract place names from a larger corpus using a gazetteer. We began by copying our classroom script into the scripts folder and renaming it appropriately and then modifying the script to read from the portfolio's gazetteer and corpus folders. To improve recall, we expanded our regex patterns to include alternative spellings and names from multiple columns in the gazetteer, allowing the script to match a wider variety of place name spellings. We also added logic to filter out articles written before the Gaza war began in October 2023 by checking the filenames for dates. Finally, we built a nested dictionary to track how often each place was mentioned per month and saved the output in regex_counts.tsv.

After this we moved to task 2B, where we focused on extracting place names using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the Stanza library. We started by copying and renaming the NER notebook we used in class, then adapted it to process only the January 2024 articles from the larger portfolio corpus. After extracting the named entities labeled as locations, we cleaned the data by merging duplicates—e.g., combining the counts for “Gaza” and “Gaza’s”—and confirmed consistent naming. The final clean list of place names and their frequencies was saved in ner_counts.tsv.

In Task 3, we built a gazetteer specifically for the NER-extracted place names. We used a geocoding service to retrieve the latitude and longitude of each location found in ner_counts.tsv. If a place could not be automatically geocoded, we looked it up manually using online resources. All results were compiled into a new file called NER_gazetteer.tsv, which includes the place name and its corresponding coordinates. We also documented the names that required manual coordinate lookup in this README.

Then in task 4A, we used Plotly Express to imagine the place mentions extracted using the regex method. We created an animated map that shows how often each place was mentioned in each month, as recorded in regex_counts.tsv. The animation helps to observe trends in media coverage over time. The resulting map was saved both as an interactive HTML file (regex_map.html) and as a static image (regex_map.png).

Finally, in Task 4B, we used Plotly Express again to map the NER-based place mentions for January 2024. We combined the frequency data from ner_counts.tsv with the coordinates from NER_gazetteer.tsv to plot the locations and their mention counts on a single map. This map was saved as ner_map.html and ner_map.png.
